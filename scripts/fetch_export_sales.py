fetch_export_sales.py — USDA FAS Weekly Export Sales (Open Data ESR API)
=========================================================================
Source:   FAS Open Data ESR API — https://apps.fas.usda.gov/OpenData/api/esr/
          The legacy apps.fas.usda.gov/export-sales/ HTML pages (esrd1.html,
          esrquery) were DECOMMISSIONED by USDA on June 2, 2026, which is why
          the old HTML-scraping version of this script silently stopped
          updating and the dashboard froze on the early-April report.

Auth:     The ESR API requires a free api.data.gov key.
          1. Get a key (30 seconds): https://api.data.gov/signup
          2. Add it as a GitHub Actions secret named FAS_API_KEY.
          3. In export_sales.yml, expose it to this step:
                 env:
                   FAS_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FAS_API_KEY }}

Schedule: Thursdays 9:30am CT (export_sales.yml)
Output:   data/export-sales.json

Marketing years:
  Corn & Soybeans:  September 1 – August 31   (ESR marketYear = start year)
  Wheat:            June 1 – May 31            (ESR marketYear = start year)

UPDATING USDA TARGETS
---------------------
After each monthly WASDE, update USDA_TARGETS below (the "Exports" row of the
US Supply & Use tables). Convert million bushels to metric tons:
  corn:     Mbu * 25_401   soybeans/wheat: Mbu * 27_216

VERIFICATION NOTE
-----------------
This rewrite targets the documented FAS Open Data ESR API but could not be
tested against the live endpoint in the build sandbox (USDA egress is blocked
there). It is written to be self-correcting where it can be — it resolves
commodity codes dynamically from /commodities, tries both marketYear
conventions, and auto-detects the 1,000-MT vs MT unit scale — and it logs
every decision verbosely. On first deploy: add the secret, run the workflow
manually, and read the log to confirm the resolved codes, units, and totals.
