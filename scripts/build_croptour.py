build_croptour.py  —  AGSIST /crop-tour page baker.

Reads data/crop-tour.json and bakes every dynamic region of crop-tour.html
between stable marker comments: the verdict hero, the nightly results board,
the three-way benchmark box, the historical accuracy table, and the stamps.

Everything lands as STATIC HTML — no client fetch — so the page is complete
for readers, search engines, and JS-blind AI crawlers on first byte. That
matters here: the tour is a 4-day search spike and crawlers arrive fast.

Derived statistics (mean absolute error, who-was-closer counts, average
bias) are COMPUTED from the history rows, never hand-typed, so adding a
year updates every claim on the page at once.

Update flow:
    1. edit data/crop-tour.json  (fill a night's corn/pods, or add a year)
    2. run:  python3 scripts/build_croptour.py

Idempotent. Self-validating: refuses to write if the result fails the gauntlet.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/build_croptour.py            # bake in place
    python3 scripts/build_croptour.py --check    # verify only (CI-safe)
    python3 scripts/build_croptour.py --selftest # arithmetic + claim checks
    python3 scripts/build_croptour.py --html PATH --json PATH


2026-08-17 — WHY THE BIAS SENTENCE CHANGED
------------------------------------------
This file printed, for months:

    it came in under the final yield in 7 of 11 years, by an average of
    2.6 bushels

Both numbers were real and neither belonged to that sentence. `tour_low` (7)
counts the years the tour finished below the final. `tour_bias` (-2.6) is the
mean signed error across ALL ELEVEN years, high ones included. Joining them
reads as "in those seven years it was 2.6 low", which is false: in those seven
years it was 5.3 low. The sentence halved the tour's own low bias, in the one
week of the year anybody reads the page, and it said the same thing inside the
FAQPage JSON-LD, where Google reads it.

That is a whole class of bug — a correct statistic wired to the wrong clause —
and it is invisible to a test that only asks whether the arithmetic is right,
because the arithmetic WAS right. So `--selftest` below does not just recompute
the means; it asserts that every number appearing in a rendered claim is one
this module actually derived for that claim. See `_check_claim_numbers`.

The other half of the same bug: "it ran high three times, once by 5.5 bushels"
was hand-typed into a file whose docstring promises derived statistics are
"never hand-typed". True in 2026, wrong the first year the tour runs high.
Both figures are computed now.
