"""
build_analyst_scorecard.py — assembles data/analyst-scorecard.json for the
USDA Report Analyst Scorecard page (analyst-scorecard.html).

Reads one human-maintained source file:
  data/analyst-estimates.json — a roster of forecasters + per-report, per-metric
  estimates, the trade consensus, and (after a report releases) the USDA actual.

and emits data/analyst-scorecard.json in the shape the page consumes:
  { updated, sample, min_n, upcoming{...}, leaderboard[...], building[...], reports[...] }

THREE SCORING VIEWS, all scale-free so corn (bil bu), wheat (mil bu) and yield
(bu/acre) can be aggregated in one table:
  • Accuracy   — mean absolute % error vs the USDA actual (lower is better)
  • Beat-trade — % of metrics where the analyst was closer than the trade consensus
  • Bias       — mean SIGNED % error (positive = runs high, negative = runs low)

Only metrics with a real `actual` are scored. Analysts need >= MIN_N scored
calls before they appear ranked (a 2-call leaderboard is noise). Everyone else
sits in `building` with their running count. No backtest is fabricated — the
file simply accrues as you fill real numbers each cycle.

Stdlib only. No secrets, no network.
