/* THE ELEVATORS WE ARE ALREADY LOOKING AT AND DO NOT READ.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 *     node scripts/board-siblings.mjs            write the worklist
 *     node scripts/board-siblings.mjs --print    and print it
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 *
 * Every cash board this repository reads names its siblings. A CoMark page
 * fetched for ANTHONY - NORTH lists ninety-odd other CoMark locations, each
 * with the location id that would address it. The adapters already capture
 * that, in `otherLocationsOnPage`, on 608 of our data files.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-05: those boards expose **964** locations. **627** are
 * already sources. **337 are not** — and they are not missing because the
 * board is hard to read or the host is slow. They are on pages we fetch every
 * poll, and reading them costs no new request, no new host, and no discovery.
 *
 * WHY THEY WERE REFUSED, WHICH IS THE HONEST PART
 *
 * agricharts-sweep.mjs will not write a source it cannot place. It joins the
 * board's location label to a town in data/known-elevators.json, and if it
 * cannot, the location goes to an `unmatched` list. That refusal is correct:
 * rule 45 says a geocode must carry how it was made, and a source with an
 * invented town is worse than no source.
 *
 * But the unmatched list was PRINTED TO THE RUN LOG AND THROWN AWAY. So the
 * number nobody knew was 337 has been sitting in expired logs, and no worklist
 * of it existed anywhere. That is what this script fixes first: the same
 * information, in a file, where it can be worked and where it can shrink.
 *
 * AND IT PLACES WHAT IT HONESTLY CAN
 *
 * The sweep's join is narrower than the data this repository holds:
 *
 *   - it reads only data/known-elevators.json (1,802 rows) when
 *     data/directory.json carries 4,581, including the state registries
 *   - it scopes to the SOURCE's state, and a co-op is not one state:
 *     CoMark's own board says "BAKER OK", "CONLEY TX", "DARROUZETT TX" while
 *     its source record says KS. Scoping to KS guarantees a miss on its own
 *     siblings.
 *   - it never reads a label that names its own state, though 25 of them do
 *
 * With those three fixed, 98 of the 337 resolve to exactly one state. 17 are
 * a town name that exists in several states with nothing to choose between
 * them, and those stay refused — a coin toss is an invented coordinate.
 * The remaining 222 are real towns in states our directory barely covers
 * (Oklahoma: 33 rows; Colorado: 29; fifteen states: none at all), and they
 * wait on a registry harvest, not on cleverer matching.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES A SOURCE. It writes a worklist. Turning a row into a
 * source is agricharts-sweep.mjs's job and it still has to satisfy every check
 * it has today.

 * its `precision` and the `via` that made it. A sibling whose town is one of
 * those does not need geocoding; it needs looking up.
 *
 * This matters because the sweep's own path to a coordinate runs through a
 * ZIP, and geocodes/zip-candidates.json is a small curated file of the ZIPs
 * this project has already needed — 743 towns. Measured: it covers **3** of
 * the 100 placeable siblings. The ZIP is only a key on the way to a
 * coordinate, and for 67 of them the coordinate is already here.
 *
 * Nothing is computed. Each row carries the coordinate that was already
 * recorded for that town, with the provenance it was recorded under, so a
 * person can see what they are getting: `town/zip-centroid` is the middle of
 * the town, not the driveway, and the worklist says so. */
