 *
 * SHARED BY BOTH READERS, WHICH IS THE POINT.
 *
 *   scripts/fetch.mjs    the GitHub Actions poller
 *   worker/src/index.js  the Cloudflare Worker
 *
 * They used to be separate implementations. `scripts/parse.mjs` and
 * `worker/src/parse.js` were byte-identical 504-line copies, and the two file
 * builders had drifted: the Worker's emitted a `dropped` field the Actions
 * one did not, so the same board read by the two readers produced two
 * different files. Nothing downstream reads `dropped`, so the only symptom
 * would have been a spurious commit every time the two handed off to each
 * other -- a price record that recorded a change in the reader rather than a
 * change in the price. `dropped` is returned alongside the file now, not
 * inside it, and there is one implementation.
 *
 * If you are about to copy this file: don't.
